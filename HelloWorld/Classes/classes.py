# classes are generally important in programming
numbers = [1, 2]
# when we use the dot notation when dealing with objects we get access to all its functions
# we can create these kinds of objects that have their own functions/methods
# a class is a blueprint for creating new objects
# an object is an instance of a class

# example: we could have a class called 'Human' which defines all the attributes of a human
# and we can create objects like john, mary jack and so on.
