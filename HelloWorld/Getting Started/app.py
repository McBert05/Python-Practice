# `print` is a built in function in python
# built in fucntions in python are meant to perform various tasks
# we can use `print` to print something on the screen


# the syntax for a basic function in python is: functionName()
# when using a fucntion we use open and closing parenthases
# when working with text use double or single quotes
# here is a demonstration of calling/using the print function to print `Hello World`
print("Hello World ðŸ‘½")  # double quotes
print('Hello World ðŸ‘½')  # single quotes

# we can change the amount of times characters appear by multiplying them using `asterisk` symbol (*) and specifying the amount of times for it to appear
print("*" * 10)
